The tidy xyz files (centers) were produced by taking the raw xyz files generated from [ConfGen](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/confgen) 
conformation generation and:
(1) ANI optimization 
then...
(2) Autograph clustering 

The logfiles contain the quantum mechanical charge calculation results from the geometry optimization of the centers using DFT B3LYP/6-31G*.

The logdispersion files were produced from the same process and level of theory as the logfiles but with the addition of gd3 empirical dispersion
for both charge and geom-opt steps. 

The alphfold pdb file contains the top rank original raw 3D structure generated from alphafold2 that was used as the starting structure for
generating the conformers.
